- 👋 Hi, I’m @jessher
- 👀 I’m interested in database creation, organization and management; querying data; and cleaning it up.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: (1) data engineering concepts through IBM's Data Engineering certification program; (2) data analysis techniques through Google's Data Analytics certification program; (3) Python and Linux Command Line using books and online resources; (4) how to pass the MS Excel Expert exam with a perfect score, because 90% is just not good enough; (5) how to create the perfect empanada dough recipe using cassava flour; (6) how to perfect my father's recipe for his (in)famous ham casserole; (7) how to use a sewing machine to make special-sized pillow cases and properly hem my curtains; (8) indoor gardening techniques and how to build a simple greenhouse; (9) a proper tune-up on an old truck I recently purchased, such as changing the oil, spark plugs, hoses, belts, and filters; and finally (10) how to love myself no matter what the voices inside my head tell me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. If someone actually trusts me to take on the small jobs that no one wants to do, like data entry or re-organization, I'm up for doing it! Because I've learned the hard way and through many mistakes that the only way to gain success is by building a solid foundation of whatever it is you want to master. No short cuts and no skimping, just diving right in and getting your hands dirty doing the tasks no one else wants to do. The problem is, everyone wants a master these days and not a student...
